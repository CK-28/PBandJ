At the same time, Garrett learns about a prophecy: the coming of a Dark Age. He embarks upon a journey to unravel a mystery that threatens the existence of the order of Keepers. Is it possible that there is a traitor in their midst?\n\nThe stealth and thievery game, Thief: Deadly Shadows comes with a number of improvements over two previous parts. Released in 2004, it left behind the aging Dark Engine, using a heavily modified Unreal engine instead. Realistic lighting effects have been implemented: each character and object now casts its own shadow. A third person's view has been made available in addition to the standard first person perspective.\n\nThe stealth system that made Thief: The Dark Project and Thief 2: The Metal Age famous is still in place. You have to stick to the shadows and avoid making noise, as guards will react to anything suspicious. It is also the first game of the series that introduced free roaming. The City, divided into several unlockable districts, is yours to explore. You can interact with the city's inhabitants: pickpocket, steal, or even mug them for loot."

It is the first game in the Baldur's Gate series and takes place in the Forgotten Realms, a high fantasy campaign setting, using a modified version of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D) 2nd edition rules. It was the first game to use the Infinity Engine for its graphics, with Interplay using the engine for other Forgotten Realms-licensed games, including the Icewind Dale series, as well as other licensed D&D campaign worlds such as Planescape: Torment. The game's story focuses on players controlling a protagonist of their own creation who finds themselves travelling across the Sword Coast alongside a party of companions, to unravel the mystery surrounding a sudden iron crisis affecting the region and attempting to discover the culprits behind it, all while uncovering dark secrets about their origins and dealing with attempts on their life."

Create any kind of character you want and explore the open wastes of post-apocalyptic Washington D.C. Every minute is a fight for survival as you encounter Super Mutants, Ghouls, Raiders and other dangers of the Wasteland. Prepare for the future.\n\nThe third game in the Fallout series, Fallout 3 is a singleplayer action role-playing game (RPG) set in a post-apocalyptic Washington DC. Combining the horrific insanity of the Cold War era theory of mutually assured destruction gone terribly wrong, with the kitschy naivety of American 1950s nuclear propaganda, Fallout 3 will satisfy both players familiar with the popular first two games in its series as well as those coming to the franchise for the first time."

Cheating his way through the Starfleet Aptitude Test, Roger is finally given the rank of captain, his own ship (a garbage scow) and a mission: to explore strange new worlds (which no man in his right mind would explore), to seek out new life and new civilizations (which grew out of the massive amounts of trash Roger will collect on his way), to boldly go where no man has gone before. Step by step Roger will have to unveil a galaxy-wide biohazardous material dumping scheme, solve the mystery of the disappearance of a fellow Starfleet captain and his ship, and confront an agent of an old nemesis."

Little does Kabuto know that the Island was home to others before him. In the oceans, there dwells a matriarchal race called the Sea Reapers.

        "summary": "Dungeon Keeper is a strategy video game in which the player attempts to build and manage a dungeon or lair while protecting it from invading 'hero' characters intent on stealing the player's accumulated treasures and killing various monsters. This was Peter Molyneux's final project with Bullfrog before he left the company in August 1997 to form Lionhead Studios.\n\nThe player uses a mouse, represented in-game as a hand, to interact with a bar on the left-hand side of the screen, allowing them to select which rooms to build and which spells to cast. The player can also use the hand to pick up creatures and objects in the dungeon and carry them around, allowing for tactics such as gathering an assault force and dropping off the creatures en masse once a foothold has been established. The hand also allows the player to \"slap\" objects and thereby interact with them: creatures will hurry up when slapped, some traps will be triggered and prisoners in the Torture Chamber can be tortured.\n\nThe main game view is in isometric perspective; this view can be zoomed and rotated. The player also has the option of possessing one of their creatures, and seeing the dungeon from that creature's first-person perspective, as well as using their attacks and abilities. The map is divided into a grid of rectangles, most of which are invisible. A smaller part of the map is shown as a minimap in the top left corner of the screen.\n\nA world map is also available, and at the beginning of the game the player is allocated one of the 20 regions of a fictional, idyllic country to destroy. As the player progresses through these regions, each of which represents a level of the game, the areas previously conquered will appear ransacked, twisted, and evil. Before starting a new level, the Mentor will tell the player about the current region and its attributes. After completing a level, the Mentor will talk about the \"improvement\" of the destroyed region: \"The streets run with the blood of the slain. Screams of pain and howls of anguish rip the night air like a vengeful siren's song. This really is somewhere you can take the kids for the weekend.\"\n\nThe Dungeon Heart represents the Dungeon Keeper's own link to the world. If it is destroyed, the player loses the level, and must restart. Along with the heart, the player begins with a small number of imps, the generic work force for all dungeon activities: they can dig tunnels into the surrounding soil, capture enemy rooms and Portals, mine gold and gems, set traps, and even attack when desperate or threatened. Slapping creatures forces them to work faster for a while, but removes some of their health and happiness.\n\nOnce the Imps are busily working, the player must then set up a basic infrastructure: Lairs for monsters, a Hatchery (where chickens, which serve as food for the minions, are bred), and a Treasury for storing gold. After connecting the dungeon to a \"Portal\", monsters will arrive. As the game progresses, the player moves along a technology tree, unlocking further rooms.\n\nThe dungeon has a fleshed-out ecology: some creatures are natural enemies. Flies and Spiders are often found at odds with one another, while a Horned Reaper, if it has gone berserk, will attack all creatures in its path. The goals for each level are fairly straightforward: they generally fall along the lines of eliminating the heroic force or destroying all other Dungeon Keepers on the level."

Driven by third-person gunplay, realistic driving mechanics and advanced graphics, Mafia immerses the player into a real-world mobster story.\n\nMafia contains a much bigger city to explore than most video games of the time, with multiple forms of available transport in addition to an expansive countryside. The game received positive reviews for the Windows version, with critics praising the game as a more realistic and serious Grand Theft Auto-styled game."

The game features a corruption feature, similar to that of the Fable games, but allowing the player to \"be evil... or really evil\", where certain actions and choices affect different aspects of the story and gameplay. While the Overlord is controlled in a third person perspective, the way minions are controlled brings elements of real-time strategy and upgrades bring those of role-playing games.

The Nintendo DS stylus becomes an extension of his evil will and every precise Touch Screen command is the player-as-Overlord directing, commanding and combining minions in battle, pointing and sweeping them to attack enemies and solving puzzles to execute his dastardly plans. Controlling the Special Farces team of four, players negotiate fiendish levels and take on a huge range of warped enemies to hunt down the Kindred, a cult dedicated to resurrecting the mighty Dragon Kin, a race of humanoid dragon hybrids, determined to replace the Overlord's despotism with their own. Extending the Overlord series' trademark humour, gameplay focuses on the mischievous physical comedy of the minion's antics and is delivered in a stylised cartoon visual style."

Having done so, raise taxes on the locals to increase your profits and punish them for serving the wrong syndicate.\n\nBut raising taxes can make you very unpopular.and furious natives leading popular rebellions can eat into syndicate profits. So keep an eye on foreign interests and pick off troublemakers with your teams of agents. And while you're busy expanding your syndicates empire abroad, rival agents are working in your own back yard to de-stabilise your syndicate. Ensure agents are briefed to weed out traitors whose actions might bring about your downfall.\n\nBy meeting all challenges, destroying all targets and gaining control of all the territories, your syndicate triumphs."

Combat is in real time with the ability to pause at any moment: tactical options include an editor which allows the player to give the AI detailed instructions on how to behave in every possible situation. Although the main storyline is the same for every character created, the game features six unique prologues, two for each race. Dragon Age: Origins received critical acclaim upon release, with praise mostly directed at its story, setting, characters, music and combat system."

Like its predecessor, players can explore and engage in combat from a third-person perspective and will also encounter various companions who play major roles in the plot and gameplay. Depending on players' decisions and dialogue, a companion will either recognize the main character Hawke as a friend or a rival. The game adopts the wheel-based dialogue system, meaning short responses that reflect different tones and attitudes the player wishes to choose for Hawke. The combat system is quite similar to the one used in the previous Dragon Age game, though it has been noticeably sped up."

This former traveling salesman trades in his briefcase for your braincase as the leading man in Wideload's first game, Stubbs the Zombie in \"Rebel Without a Pulse\".\n\nIn this game, players take on the role of the rebel himself Stubbs, a wisecracking Zombie who takes on an ultra-modern city of the future using nothing but his own carcass and the weapons of his possessed enemies. The game's tongue-in-cheek humor, innovative combat and strong storyline keep Stubbs the Zombie's gameplay as bizarre and unpredictable as its namesake.\n\nOn his quest, Stubbs lurches his way through numerous large and visually captivating indoor/outdoor environments in and around the gleaming city of Punchbowl, PA, a city built during the Eisenhower administration to show off the ultra-futuristic technology of the 21st century. Stubbs' brain-eating adventure brings him through bustling shopping districts and verdant farmlands to battle mad scientists, rural militiamen and the world's deadliest barbershop quartet. His enemies have shotguns, tanks, and all manner of futuristic weaponry. All Stubbs has is his own rotting corpse, a distinct lack of pain or conscience, and the ability to turn foes into zombie allies.\n\nWhat begins as one zombie's search for revenge quickly escalates into an all-out war between the living and the dead - but this time it's the zombie fighting for truth, justice and the redemption of true love. Yes, it's a love story too."

Each selected character can parlay the experience gained from combat into acquiring new feats and enhanced abilities over time. To help in battle, a new item creation system lets players craft magical weapons and armor using raw materials found during their travels.\n\nAs before, two heroes can join the adventure in cooperative play on the same screen, with each character differing in the types of feats and powers under his or her command. Equipment can be found or purchased from local merchants using the gold looted from felled creatures or received as payment for quests. Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II also features a number of hidden areas, secret characters, and literally hundreds of items to find and use, including potions, scrolls, and wands. In addition, the game features a new branching storyline that offers players a choice where to go next for fortune and honor."

        "summary": "Just like its predecessors Need for Speed: High Stakes is an action racing game with a wide selection of exotic sports cars and many different types of tracks. The trademark Hot Pursuit mode game mode from the first game in the series is still present, where players race opponents on tracks filled with regular traffic and police cars that chase the racers. The classic pursuit mode is extended with two additional modes: Getaway and Time Trap. In Getaway the player needs to shake off the police in a set amount of time, or playing as the police trap a speeder before time runs out. In Time Trap an entire race needs to be completed before time runs out, or as the police all speeders need to be arrested. There are minor differences between the two platforms for this game mode, regarding spike strips, road blocks, and back-up. The latter for instance is unique to the PlayStation version. The Pursuit mode is available in multiplayer as well and players can take different sides or race together. \n \nIt is the first game in the series to introduce a Career mode with a set of challenges. Beating these is rewarded with trophies for unlocks, and money to spend on new cars, repairs and upgrades. In the PlayStation version the Career mode is split up into two different sets of challenges: Tournament (required races) and Special Event (optional races). High Stakes in the title refers to races where players bet their cars. In the PC version these are a part of the Career mode when the player owns more than two cars. In the PlayStation version two players can insert their memory cards and race against each other. The winner immediately receives the opponent's car and it is deleted from the loser's memory card right away. \n \nIn addition to the new game modes it is also the first game in the series to have a detailed physics models. Damage now affects both the appearance and the performance of the car for the first time."

He then receives a race challenge from a rather ominous personality who offers him a spot on his crew, but \"won't take 'no' for an answer.\" The player races off — despite Samantha's warnings — only to be ambushed by a mysterious driver in a rage that totals his Skyline. The driver, who has a unique scythe tattoo, makes a call confirming the accident, and the flashback fades out."
