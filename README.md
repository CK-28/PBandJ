# PlayingBacklog-J
This is a game collection tracking app that aims to create a perfectly simple and smooth experience to its user. The app allows the user to search for games and add them to one of four lists. These lists are Playing, for in-progress games, backlog, for games to be started, on-going, for multiplayer and other games with no real ending, and completed, for finished games.
